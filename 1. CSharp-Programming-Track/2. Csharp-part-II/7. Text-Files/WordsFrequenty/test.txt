I eat some food on the table and drink beer,beer,beer, milk, vodka, martini.
John john smith has son named michael to his grandfather osvaldo the brown,brown,browny hear.
Osvaldo is very old and like to drink vodka, beer and rakya. He write on the whiteboard with green marker
and make green circles. They are similar to martini with cherry and menta with vodka. After some years osvaldo
the brown,brown,,brown,brownbrowny hear died. Funny story...
